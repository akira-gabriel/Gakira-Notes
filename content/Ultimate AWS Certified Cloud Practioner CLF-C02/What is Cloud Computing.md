## **Server Components**
- **Compute**: CPU
- **Memory**: RAM

- **Storage**: Data

- **Database**: Store data in a structured way

- **Network**: Routers, switch, DNS server

## **IT Terminology**
- **Network**: The connection between cables, routers and servers
- **Router**: Device that delivers data packages between PC and networks 
- **Switch**: Takes a packet and send to correct server or client on your network

## **Problems with Traditional TI approach**
- Price (data center, power supply, cooling, maintenance)
- Time for adding and replacing hardware
- Scaling is limited
- 24/7 team monitoring the infrastructure
- Disasters

## **What is Cloud Computing?
- Is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications and others IT resources
- Pay-as-you-go-pricing
- Provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
- You can access as many resources, almost instantly
- Simple way to access servers, storage, database and a set of application services
- Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected for required for those application services

## **The Deployment Models of the Cloud?
### Private Cloud
- Used by a single organization, not exposed to the public
- Complete control
- Security for sensitive applications
- Meet specific business need

### Public Cloud
- Cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the internet
- Six advantages of Cloud Computing

### Hybrid Cloud
- Extend some capabilities to the Cloud
- Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
- Flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud

## **The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing?
- **On-demand self service:**
	- Users can provision resources and use without human interaction from the service provider
	
- **Broad network access:**
	- Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms

- **Multi-tenacy and resource pooling:**
	- Multiple costumers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
	- Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources

- **Rapid elasticity and scalability:**
	- Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
	- Quickly and easily scale based on demand

- **Measured service:**
	- Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

## **Six advantages of Cloud Computing##
- **Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)**
	- Pay on-demand, don't own hardware
	- Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Operational Expense (OPEX)
- **Benefit from massive economies of scale**
	- Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
- **Stop guessing capacity**
	- Scale based on actual measured usage
- **Increase speed and agility**
 - **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers**
 - **Go global in minutes:** leverage the AWS global infrastructure

## **Problems solved by Cloud Computing##
-  **Flexibility:** change resource types when needed
-  **Cost-Effectiveness:** pay as you go, for what you use
-  **Scalability:** accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
-  **Elasticity:** ability scale out and scale-in when needed
-  **High-availability and fault-tolerance:** build across data centers
-  **Agility:** rapidly develop, test and launch software applications
